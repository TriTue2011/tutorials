## Voice Assist - Devices Schedules / Timers

Automatically create, extend, pause, resume, or cancel **device schedules** through natural voice commands.
Each schedule controls one or multiple smart devices (such as lights, fans, or air conditioners) and automatically restores itself after Home Assistant restarts.

Unlike Home Assistant's built-in timers, this tool manages **device-based schedules** independently, supports **multiple concurrent schedules**, and performs **automatic actions** (turning devices on or off when the schedule ends).
You can simply speak naturally - Voice Assist (an LLM such as Gemini/GPT) will interpret, create, and manage these schedules automatically.

**Key Features:**

- Supports modes: **start**, **extend**, **pause**, **resume**, **cancel**, **cancel_all**, **list**
- Manage **multiple devices and schedules simultaneously**
- **Auto-restores** schedules after Home Assistant restarts
- **Integrated with Voice Assist (LLMs)** for natural multi-language commands
- Customizable end actions: turn on/off devices, send notifications, or trigger other scripts

**Example Voice Commands:**

- "Set a schedule to turn off the living room fan in 15 minutes."
- "Extend the kitchen light schedule by 10 minutes."
- "Add a schedule to turn off the bedroom air conditioner at 6 a.m."
- "Cancel all device schedules."
- "What device schedules are currently active?"

**Use Cases:**

- Schedule **lights, fans, air conditioners, heaters, or water heaters**
- Run **multiple independent schedules** per device
- Pause, resume, or extend existing schedules easily
- Serve as a **foundation for voice-driven device automation** in smart homes
