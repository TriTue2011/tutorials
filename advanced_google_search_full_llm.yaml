    # Tool for searching Google information used for Voice Assistant

    ## Blueprint Setup

    ### Required

    * This blueprint is exclusively designed for Google Generative AI only.

    * A Conversation Agent with Google Search tool enabled, create it if it doesn't already exist.

    * Increase the agent's maximum token limit to enable it to gather comprehensive information, with a minimum requirement of 16384 tokens.

    * Agent Instructions:

    ```

    You are a voice assistant.

    Always respond in the same language as the question.

    If in Vietnamese, reply in Vietnamese; if in English, reply in English.

    Current date and time: {{ now().isoformat(timespec='seconds') }}.

    ```

    ### Optional

    * Adjust the prompts for each field used in the script. The descriptions guide the LLM to provide the correct input.

    ### Note

    * Provide a concise and precise description for the script. This description will enable the LLM to recognize that the script is designed to search for information from Google.

    * Make sure to expose the script to Assist after the script has been saved.

    * Do not alter the default script name.

        Instructions:

        - Perform up to three iterative refinements. Avoid duplicate sources; prioritize recent, authoritative content.

        - Provide both a concise overview and expanded details to minimize the need for follow-up searches.

        - Optionally include source names (publisher/site, date).

        - Always use the Google Search tool for factual lookups. If no results are found, state this clearly and suggest refined queries. Never fabricate sources.
