    # Tool gets events from calendar used for Voice Assistant

    ## Blueprint Setup

    ### Required

    - Set one or more calendar entities for which you want to get the events.

    ### Optional

    - Adjust the prompts for each field used in the script. The descriptions guide the LLM to provide the correct input.

    ### Note

    - Provide a concise and precise description for the script. This script will be utilized by the LLM to understand that it should obtain events from the specified calendars.
    - Make sure to expose the script to Assist after the script has been saved.
    - Do not alter the default script name.
    - Once the script is created, click the three dots in the top right corner, choose "Edit in YAML," and remove the `description: ...` line to restore the default. This step is important because it helps the LLM better understand the script's purpose.

        time_period_type_prompt:
          name: Time Period Type Prompt
          description: The prompt which will be used for the LLM can provide the type for the period (days or hours).
          selector:
            text:
              multiline: true
          default: |
            This argument is mandatory and must always be included.
            Use 'daily' for requests covering full days or periods longer than one day. Use 'hourly' for requests covering part of a day or a specific start time.
            After obtaining the result, ensure the response includes only the event's day of the week and start date. The event's end date or time is exclusive and should not be included.
        time_period_length_prompt:
          name: Time Period Length Prompt
          description: The prompt which will be used for the LLM can provide the length of the period.
          selector:
            text:
              multiline: true
          default: |
            This argument is mandatory and must always be included.
            The length of the period. This will be measured in days if 'time_period_type' is 'daily', and in hours if 'time_period_type' is 'hourly'.
            Examples: 1 (day) for today's events, 2 (days) for weekend events, 7 (days) for the next few days, 30 (days) for in the month, 6 (hours) for morning, afternoon, or evening events.
        date_prompt:
          name: Date Prompt
          description: The prompt which will be used for the LLM can provide the start date for the events period.
          selector:
            text:
              multiline: true
          default: |
            This argument is mandatory and must always be included.
            Specify the date for the requested period starts using the format YYYY-MM-DD.
            Always include a date with each request. If the request does not specify a date, you should provide today's date. Examples of dates that can be used include today, this week, this month, etc.
            When the requested period is for the night, do not use today's date but always use the next day, unless the current time is still before 05:00:00.
        time_prompt:
          name: Time Prompt
          description: The prompt which will be used for the LLM can provide the start time for the events period.
          selector:

          default: |
            This argument is mandatory and must always be included.
            Specify the start time using the format HH:MM:SS.
            Always provide time. For a full day, use 00:00:00. For the current hour, use the start of the hour. Night starts at 00:00:00, morning starts at 06:00:00, afternoon starts at 12:00:00 and evening starts at 18:00:00.
