    # Device Ringing Tool using LLM

    ## Features

    * This script is designed to send notifications to devices with the Home Assistant Companion App installed,
    specifically for the purpose of determining the device's location.

    ## Blueprint Setup

    ### Required

    * An online LLM like Gemini or OpenAI.

    * Home Assistant Companion App must be installed on the device.

    * The device must allow notifications permission for Home Assistant Companion App.

    * The device must allow critical alerts for Home Assistant Companion App (iOS).

    ### Optional

    * Adjust the prompts for each field used in the script.
    The descriptions guide the LLM to provide the correct input.

    ### Note

    * Provide a concise and precise description for the script.
    This description will enable the LLM to recognize that the
    script is designed to ring the mobile device.

    * Make sure to expose the script to Assist after the script has been saved.
