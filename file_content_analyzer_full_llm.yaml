    # Tool designed to analyze and extract all types of information from media and document files

    ## Blueprint Setup

    ### Required

    * An AI Task entity must be created and configured in the System - General settings.

    ### Optional

    * Adjust the prompts for each field used in the script. The descriptions guide the LLM to provide the correct input.

    ### Note

    * Provide a concise and precise description for the script. This description will enable the LLM to recognize that the script is designed to extract data from a media or document file.

    * Make sure to expose the script to Assist after the script has been saved.

    * Do not alter the default script name.
