    # Tool plays YouTube video to TV

    ## Blueprint Setup

    ### Required

    * An Android TV Media Player.

    ### Optional

    * Adjust the prompts for each field used in the script. The descriptions guide
    the LLM to provide the correct input.

    ### Note

    * Give the script a clear description. This will be used by the LLM to understand
    it should use this script for date conversion from Solar date to Lunar date and vice versa.

    * Make sure to expose the script to Assist after the script has been saved.
