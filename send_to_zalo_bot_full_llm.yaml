    # Tool for sending content to Zalo using LLM

    ## Blueprint Setup

    ### Required

    * Create a Zalo bot if it does not already exist using Zalo Bot Creator.

    * The Pyscript integration needs to be installed through HACS and properly configured.

    * The `scripts/zalo_bot_handle_tool.py` script needs to be copied into the `config/pyscript` folder.

    * The `scripts/requirements.txt` file needs to be copied into the `config/pyscript` folder.

    * A Zalo bot token needs to be configured in `config/configuration.yaml`.

    ```

    #File configuration.yaml

    pyscript:
      allow_all_imports: true
      hass_is_global: true
      zalo_bot_token: !secret zalo_bot_token

    ```

    ```

    #File secrets.yaml

    zalo_bot_token: XXXXXX      # Retrieve the token from the Zalo Bot Creator.

    ```

    ### Optional

    * Adjust the prompts for each field used in the script. The descriptions guide the LLM to provide the correct input.

    ### Note

    * Provide a concise and precise description for the script. This will be utilized by the LLM to understand it should use this script for sending user requested content to Zalo.

    * Make sure to expose the script to Assist after the script has been saved.

    * Do not alter the default script name.
